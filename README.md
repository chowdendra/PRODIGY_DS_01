Welcome to my submission for Task 1 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech. In this task, I have conducted an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the provided dataset, with a focus on visualizing the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.

**Dataset**
The dataset utilized for this task is the world_population_dataset, which comprises records of population data spanning from 2001 to 2022.

**Tools and Libraries Used**
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The following steps were carried out during the EDA process:

Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values, duplicates, and outliers to ensure data integrity.
Visualization: Developed visualizations such as bar charts and stacked charts to effectively represent the distribution of the selected variable.
Conclusion
This EDA process provided valuable insights into the distribution patterns within the dataset. The analysis serves as a critical foundation for further exploration and modeling tasks in the data science workflow.

Thank you for taking the time to review my submission!
